# Introduction to Databases - The Folder Analogy

When it comes to databases, we can compare them to folders on a Windows computer.

## What is a Database?

A database in comparison to a folder, stores and organizes related files and information. It acts as a container that holds multiple tables, similar to how a folder can contain various files and sub-folders.

## Tables as Files

Just as files in a folder contain data or information, tables in a database store structured data. Each table represents a collection of related information, similar to how a file contains a collection of related data.
