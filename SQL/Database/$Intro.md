# Introduction to Databases

When it comes to Databases, we can compare them to folders on a Windows computer.
A Database in comparison to a folder, stores and organizes related files and information.
It acts as a container that holds multiple Tables, similar to how a folder can contain various files and sub-folders.
Just as files in a folder contain Data or information, Tables in a Database store structured Data.
Each Table represents a collection of related information, similar to how a file contains a collection of related Data.
