# Introduction to Tables

A Table is a collection of Data stored in Rows and Columns.
Tables are the most common and fundamental way to store Data in a relational Database.
The Columns in a Table are called fields while the Rows can be referred to as records.
A Table is also considered a relation, which is why the term relational Database is used to describe Databases that use Tables to store Data.
