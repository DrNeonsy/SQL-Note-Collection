# Introduction to Tables

A Table is a collection of data stored in rows and columns.
Tables are the most common and fundamental way to store data in a relational Database.
The columns in a Table are called fields while the rows can be referred to as records.
A Table is also considered a relation, which is why the term relational Database is used to describe databases that use tables to store data.
